# React QR From Submitter (WIP)

Netlify deployed link: [https://naughty-mcnulty-e2ca77.netlify.app/](https://naughty-mcnulty-e2ca77.netlify.app/)\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

To submit a form to a your IT support department or technician to
inform him/her/they of the faulty part in question and description
of the fault.

## How it works

Point the camera in your mobile device to scan a QR code that is pasted onto your component, which will lead to a form submission page
where you can fill in your details. And then submit!

## WIP

So far, most of the functionality is not out yet... Just the front-end interface. If only a day has more than 24 hours...
Looking to port over to React Native as it has easier access into mobile device camera.

## To-do list

- [ ] Select type of camera (e.g. some devices have 3 back cameras)
- [x] Basic Front End interface
- [x] Bootstrap Form!
- [x] Trying out Github Markdown syntax
- [x] Deploying to Netlify
- [ ] Link to database (MongoDB etc.)
- [ ] And many more!
